//! Command modules.
//!
//! Convention (every command author MUST follow this):
//!
//!   pub async fn run(args: crate::<Args>) -> crate::error::Result<()>
//!
//! - The arg struct is the clap-derive `Args` type defined in `main.rs` for that
//!   command (e.g. `crate::ProjectsArgs`). It is moved in by value.
//! - Local research commands read the local store directly. Commands that use
//!   account, organization, sandbox, or compute APIs load credentials themselves
//!   via `crate::error::require_credentials().await`.
//! - Return `Ok(())` on success; propagate errors with `?`. `main` prints the
//!   error and exits 1.
//! - For early-exit "usage" errors that the TS prints to stderr + exit(1),
//!   return `Err(anyhow!(...))` (clap already enforces required positionals, so
//!   most of those usage guards are unnecessary in the Rust port).
