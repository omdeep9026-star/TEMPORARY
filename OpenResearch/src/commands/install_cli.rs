//! `orx install-cli` — put `orx` on the user's PATH from the macOS app.
//!
//! The app bundle already carries an `orx` alias next to its executable (agents
//! the app spawns get it via `chat::prepare_env`), but a human's own terminal
//! never sees it. This links that alias into `~/.local/bin`, so an app-only
//! install gains a CLI that is, by construction, the exact build the app
//! updates — one binary, one version, one updater.
//!
//! `~/.local/bin` rather than `/usr/local/bin`: it needs no admin rights, and
//! writing outside the user's home from a GUI app is a bigger promise than this
//! feature is worth. When it isn't on PATH we print the line to add rather than
//! editing shell rc files, which are the user's to own.
