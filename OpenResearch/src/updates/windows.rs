//! Self-update on Windows. The PowerShell installer does the download and the
//! unpacking, as the shell installer does elsewhere; this module supplies the
//! two things Windows makes the binary do for itself.
//!
//! Windows refuses to overwrite a mapped executable but allows renaming it. So
//! the installer unpacks into a staging directory, and only then is the
//! installed `orx.exe` renamed aside and the new one renamed into its place —
//! two renames, with no window in which `orx.exe` is half-written. The retired
//! copy is deleted by a later start, once every process that mapped it has
//! exited.
//!
//! There is no `exec`, so a restarting `orx up` spawns the new binary and exits;
//! the child waits on the parent's process handle before binding the port.
