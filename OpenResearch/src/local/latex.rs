//! a machine with no toolchain gets a clear message instead of a silent
//! failure. The documents are agent-authored, so every engine runs
//! non-interactively and with shell escape off.
//!
//! The target is Overleaf parity, which means `latexmk` over a real TeX
//! distribution: it picks the engine the document asks for, runs biber or
//! bibtex when the bibliography needs it, and repeats passes until references
//! settle. Where latexmk is absent we drive the engine directly and orchestrate
//! that ourselves; where nothing but `tectonic` exists we use it and say so,
//! since it is XeTeX and cannot honour a document that wants LuaLaTeX.
