You inspected the complete recorded logs, parsed all 5,000 base-training loss points, all 1,499 SFT loss points, validation BPB checkpoints, phase throughput, and CORE evaluation metrics. You generated and visually checked these four durable artifacts: nanochat-base-training-curves.svg, nanochat-sft-training-curves.svg, nanochat-training-throughput.svg, and nanochat-core-evaluation.svg.

const LITERATURE_BOOTSTRAP_CONTEXT: &str = r#"You are continuing a live OpenResearch demo session. The user asked whether weak, repetitive generations from the completed 73.5M-parameter nanochat run were primarily caused by insufficient pretraining, model size, data quality, or the SFT recipe.

You inspected the recorded training evidence and relevant scaling, alignment, and small-model literature. You concluded that insufficient pretraining is the primary bottleneck, model size is a secondary ceiling, and SFT likely amplifies repetition without being able to create knowledge absent from pretraining. The model saw 81.92M tokens, or 3.53 tokens per nanochat scaling parameter, and base validation BPB was still improving at step 5,000.

You recommended a one-factor pretraining-token ablation: keep the d6 model and every other recipe choice fixed, train from scratch to nanochat's target ratio of 12 (278,396,928 tokens / 16,992 steps), evaluate checkpoints at 5,000, about 11,000, and 16,992 steps, then apply the identical 1,500-step SFT recipe only to the final checkpoint. The full note is saved as nanochat-bottleneck-diagnosis.md.

Continue naturally from this completed state."#;

const BOOTSTRAP_CONTEXT: &str = r#"You are continuing a live OpenResearch demo session. The following exchange already happened and is authoritative project context.

The user asked you to run nanochat's CPU/Apple-Silicon pipeline end to end, surface validation and evaluation metrics, repair setup issues, and confirm the trained model can answer the capital of France.

You inspected the repository and prepared the CPU pipeline before launching it: caches were made checkout-local, SFT conversations longer than a row were excluded, all-masked SFT batches were guarded, periodic ChatCORE was disabled for Apple-Silicon memory safety, and the chat CLI was made to re-enter the project environment. You created the CPU baseline experiment and completed one successful run.

Recorded results: a 6-layer 73.5M-parameter model trained for 5,000 base steps over 81.92M tokens; final training validation BPB 1.165758; base-eval train/validation BPB 1.152185/1.119301; SFT completed 1,500 steps with final validation BPB 0.7389. The final CLI loaded the SFT checkpoint and answered that the capital of France is Paris. The results are saved in cpu-apple-silicon-pipeline-results.md.

Two idle follow-up experiments already branch from that baseline, each with a complete run command and no code changes needed: demo_nanochat_lr_probe_v1 (Muon matrix LR 2× probe) and demo_nanochat_vocab_probe_v1 (8,192-token vocabulary probe). Both are short 200-step base-training probes on the local backend whose learning-rate schedule matches the baseline's first 200 steps, so their validation BPB compares directly with the baseline's 1.940739 at step 100 and 1.762539 at step 200.

Operational note: when the user asks to run one of them, launch it immediately with `orx exp run <expId>`. Do not load skills, read compute references, or re-inspect the experiment tree first; follow the run's logs and report the comparison.

const REPORT: &str = r#"# nanochat CPU / Apple-Silicon pipeline results

This bundled demo records a completed local `runs/runcpu.sh` pipeline on Apple Silicon. It is historical evidence included with OpenResearch; onboarding does not rerun training on the new user's machine.

## Base training and evaluation

- Model: d6, 6 layers, 73.5M parameters, sequence length 512
- Training: 5,000 steps, 81.92M tokens, 131.55 minutes
- Final training-loop validation BPB: 1.165758
- Base-eval train BPB: 1.152185
- Base-eval validation BPB: 1.119301
- CORE accuracy: wikidata 0.0000, openbook 0.2500, winogrande 0.5625, operators 0.0000

## Supervised fine-tuning

- Started from the validated base checkpoint with a fresh optimizer
- Training: 1,500 steps, 39.07 minutes
- Validation BPB: 1.0174 → 1.0580 → 0.9914 → 0.9513 → 0.9141 → 0.8483 → 0.7950 → 0.7486 → 0.7389
- Final/minimum validation BPB: 0.7389

## Chat confirmation

The final command loaded the step-1499 SFT checkpoint on MPS and answered: “Paris … The capital of France is Paris.”

## Evidence pack

The `evidence/` directory contains the real checkpoint metadata, trained tokenizer, structured metrics, final inference transcript, and a manifest of both bundled and omitted run outputs. To reduce the bundled demo project's download size, large model weights, optimizer states, datasets, and environments are intentionally omitted.

## Portable setup repairs

- Kept nanochat and uv caches inside the checkout.
- Excluded conversations longer than the SFT row capacity and guarded all-masked batches.
- Disabled memory-heavy periodic ChatCORE while retaining validation BPB.
- Made the chat CLI reuse the project environment and recorded cache location.

            "The main bottleneck is insufficient pretraining. Model size sets the eventual ceiling; the SFT recipe likely worsens repetition but cannot manufacture knowledge the base model never learned.\n\nWhy:\n\n- The model saw only 81.9M tokens. Under nanochat’s own scaling convention, that is 3.53 tokens per scaling parameter, versus its default target of 12.\n- Base validation BPB was still improving at the endpoint: 1.1878 at step 4,000 → 1.1743 at 4,500 → 1.1658 at 5,000. The model had not converged.\n- [Chinchilla](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) establishes that substantially scaling training tokens is generally preferable to leaving a model undertrained. Its canonical ~20-token ratio is not directly comparable because nanochat counts parameters differently, but the direction is unambiguous.\n- [LIMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206) supports the view that SFT mostly exposes capabilities acquired during pretraining. It also reports that validation perplexity can continue improving after generation quality peaks—matching your falling SFT loss but poor free-running behavior.\n- [TinyStories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759) shows that 73.5M parameters are sufficient for coherent generation on a constrained, high-quality distribution. Thus size alone does not explain the repetition. Conversely, broad MMLU/GSM8K performance at this size will remain limited.\n- [Textbooks Are All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11644) makes pretraining-data quality an important subsequent axis, but your run is too undertrained to diagnose quality cleanly yet.\n\nRun this next:\n\n- Train the identical d6 model from scratch with the same data and recipe, changing only the pretraining horizon to `--target-param-data-ratio=12`.\n- That gives 278,396,928 tokens or 16,992 steps—3.4× the current exposure.\n- Evaluate checkpoints at 5,000, ~11,000, and 16,992 steps using fixed prompts, base BPB, CORE, and a repetition metric.\n- Apply the identical 1,500-step SFT recipe only to the final checkpoint and compare ChatCORE, MMLU, GSM8K, and generation.\n\nDo not change SFT simultaneously; that would obscure whether additional pretraining solved the problem. If repetition remains after the longer-pretrained base improves, the following round should test SFT early stopping/lower learning rate using generation and ChatCORE—not validation loss—as the selection criterion.\n\nI saved the full diagnosis as the project artifact [{}]({}).",
